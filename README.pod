=head1 NAME

File::Find::Rule::PPI - Add support for PPI queries to File::Find::Rule

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use File::Find::Rule      ();
  use File::Find::Rule::PPI ();

  # Find all perl modules that use here-docs
  my $Find = File::Find::Rule->file
                             ->name('*.pm')
                             ->ppi_find_any('Token::HereDoc');
  my @heredoc = $Find->in( $dir );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

File::Find::Rule::PPI allows you to integrate PPI content queries
into your L<File::Find::Rule> searches.

Initially, it provides the one additional method C<ppi_find_any>,
which takes an argument identical to the L<PPI::Node> method C<find_any>
and checks each file as a perl document to see if matches the query.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 ppi_find_any $condition | $PPI::Find

The C<ppi_find_any> method causes a query identical to (and implemented
using) L<PPI::Node>'s C<find_any> method.

It takes as argument any condition that would also be valid for the above
method.

In addition, it can also take as argument an instantiated L<PPI::Find>
object, and will use that object's C<any_matches> method to achieve the
same effect.

If you provide no or an illegal condition to ppi_find_any, the check will
always fail, and B<no> files will be returned when you execute the search.
